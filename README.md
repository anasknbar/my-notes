## about myself
> 
My name is **Anas Knbar**, and I am 26 years old. I hold a degree in Medical Laboratory Science and have worked in the medical field for one year. Despite my medical background, I have a strong interest in the IT field, which prompted me to pursue programming during my university studies. Unfortunately, I couldn't fully engage in it due to a lack of time and experience. Consequently, I have decided to enroll in this course to learn from a great team of instructors and teaching assistants (TAs).
## What Did I Learn in Class-01
> 1. In the first part of the class, we learned about the differences between the CLI and GUI:
   - GUI is a user-friendly interface and is a good choice for beginners. It uses a screen, buttons, mouse, and even touch to interact.
   - CLI is less user-friendly than GUI; it uses command lines to interact, making it a good choice for developers as the commands run faster and more efficiently.

> 2. In the second part, we covered the Version Control System (VCS):
   - VCS is a system that enables developers to add, modify, and track changes to the source code.
   - It also enables developers to collaborate efficiently.
   - Git/GitHub is an example of a VCS.

> 3. In the third part:
   - We saw an example of VCS using GitHub and a **README** file.
   - We also covered the Markdown language and its purposes.
